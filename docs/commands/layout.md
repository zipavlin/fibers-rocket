# Layout

```bash
php artisan fibers:layout <Title> [Options]
```

This command will create layout [Views](https://laravel.com/docs/views) in path set in `config/view.paths` into a new folder named after targeted model.  

Command creates only view that are needed, based on either `only/except` options or targeted model's controller if one is found:
* **index**: a table list of model's records (uses `_item.blade.php`)
* **show**: show single record's data
* **create**: create a new record (uses `_form.blade.php`)
* **edit**: edit existing record (uses `_form.blade.php`)
* **_item**: partial view with a single record data
* **_form**: partial view with model's attributes

::: tip
Set targeted model by using `--target=` options to skip model input prompt.
